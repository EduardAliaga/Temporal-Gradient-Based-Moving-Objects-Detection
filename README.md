# Temporal-Gradient-Based-Moving-Objects-Detection
Temporal gradient–based moving object detection in grayscale video from a stationary camera. The project evaluates finite-difference and derivative-of-Gaussian temporal filters, spatial smoothing, and fixed, percentile, and adaptive MAD-based thresholds to achieve robust motion segmentation with improved noise suppression and spatial coherence
